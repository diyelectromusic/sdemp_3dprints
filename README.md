# Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects - 3DPrints

This repository houses some of the 3D print designs for my Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects website - https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at 3D print design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

# Support

I do not offer support for any of these projects, there are provided "as is" (see license).

But I will attempt to answer any queries posted to a public forum.  More here: https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/support/.

# Using my designs

These are usually developed in OpenSCAD (https://openscad.org/) and I'll try to publish code and resultant STL files where possible.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to note any additional information in the readme for each project and please read carefully the design and build information from the blog before spending any time or funds on any of these designs as that is where I will have documented my (countless, no doubt) mistakes in the design!

These are for my own personal hobby use, but I'm very happy for anyone to take them as inspiration for their own projects (given the warnings, caveats and context above).
